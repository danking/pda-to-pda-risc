PDA Compiler
====================

macro-glue.rkt provides the pda macro which has the following form:

  (pda token-convert get-token drop-token eos-stream?
       (clauses ...))

token-convert : X -> TokenSymbol
get-token : InputStream -> X
drop-token : InputStream -> InputStream
eos-stream? : InputStream -> Boolean

We can take the output from the DeRemer Penello algorithm and feed it to the pda
macro after minor modifications. First, the DRP algorithm produces unreachable
states and never-used rules. We must remove these because the stack type
inference algorithm will fail if it finds unreachable states. Then, we must
remove the NO-SHIFT and ERROR forms because these are not found in the PDA
grammar used by the pda macro. Furthermore, we must add a START form specifying
the initial state. Finally, we must convert scheme48/scsh idioms, such as
(if #f #f), to proper Racket code.

The procedure parameters used in DRP are slightly different than the ones
expected by the pda macro. Instead of token-case, a piece of syntax which
creates a case form, pda asks for token-convert which converts a token from the
stream into a token declared in the TOKENS form. The pda get-token argument
expects only one argument, the stream; the DRP's get-token argument expected
both a stream and a lookahead. Finally, the pda macro neglects an error handler
and adds an empty-stream? procedure, which checks if the stream is empty.
